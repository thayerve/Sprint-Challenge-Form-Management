- [ ] Why are forms used so often in web applications and software?

It’s the best way to get lots of kinds of data from users and control what happens to that data.


- [ ] What advantages are there by using a forms library like Formik?

Using Formik, we can avoid having to write out the tedious obvious things that need to be written for every form, like telling the form to handleSubmit on submit, or to handle a click onClick, setting the state to the values, etc. It also helps us handle validation and errors.

- [ ] Why do we write tests for our apps?

We write tests to make sure each part of the app does what we want it to do, and so the user experiences what we expect and intend them to experience. It helps us catch bugs sooner and makes us be more thoughtful about the app code that we’re writing. Automated tests also save time and costs over the alternative of manual testing.
